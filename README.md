# Work Day Scheduler
## This program allows you to add events to your day and plan based on the hour
In this program you are presented with a UI which shows the workday from 9-5, split up
by hours. In each hour you can click on the text area to make changes and use the save button
on the right to save those changes into local storage. The program also highlights the current 
hour red, past hours grey and future hours green. The current date is also displayed at the top.
